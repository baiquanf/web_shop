Your task is to implement backend application library to product catalog and shopping basket of a web shop. Product catalog contains at least names, amounts for sale (i.e. stock) and prices of available products. Shopping basket contains products from catalog and to­be­purchased amounts. Don’t forget to keep the product catalog up to date: products and stocks are updated based on the reservations in the basket.
